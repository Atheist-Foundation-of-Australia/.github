# Atheist Foundation of Australia
The Atheist Foundation of Australia Inc began in South Australia in 1970 when the members of the Rationalist Association of SA decided that a name change would proclaim their basic philosophy, which began in Greece 2500 years ago.
We can understand why primitive cultures believed that invisible beings controlled what we now call the elements and natural phenomena. With access to factual knowledge, there is now no excuse for believing in gods, fairies or any supernatural concept.
We live in a natural universe with known natural laws. Religion, based on belief in the existence of the supernatural, is dependent on the indoctrination of infants generation after generation, by parents brainwashed in religious cultures.
The confrontations and fighting today provide ample evidence of the unstable nature of societies, which endorse religious beliefs.
Infantile concepts seriously hinder the full potential development of humans in a world with problems that require logical thought.
Atheists find their motive for action in the needs and problems of their fellow citizens and consider that the worship of, or reliance on, imaginary supernatural beings to be a useless waste of time, energy and resources.
The Foundation is dependent on a small committee which meets monthly and is open to all members. We maintain a cordial relationship with similar organisations within Australia and overseas and with whom we exchange our magazine, The Australian Atheist.
It is recognised that the non-religious segment in society is on a steep increase but only through such organisations as the Foundation will it be recognised as a movement worthy of notice by administrative bodies.
We welcome feedback from thoughtful people and invite your co-operation and membership.
